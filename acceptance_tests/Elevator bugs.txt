Bug fix notes

to fix race condition by adding a delay:
	add a counter that only lets it go into slow state from stop state once it reaches 2.
	set it to 0 when it reaches slow state
	increment it when it reaches a point where it should transition into slow state
	
	
To fix when it misses a commitpoint and doesn't stop till it crashes:
	increase the 0.5 to 1 in the commit_point_reached value
