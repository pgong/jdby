    Group 22 - Brody Anderson (bcanders), Jeff Lau (jalau), David Chow
    (davidcho), Yang Liu (yangliu2)<br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you
    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicitly state how a .cf file should be written. While the
        end result is very simple, I found myself scrambling to find
        some resource before finally getting the simple solution from a
        TA several hours later.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No Suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    Project 3<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The instructions for the various assignments associated with
        this project, while all documented well, were not presented in a
        very clear manner. This made the assignment of tasks somewhat
        confusing.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 4 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The state variable CurrentFloor can be assigned to the floor
        just reached previously instead of None. This will make it more
        consistent.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 5 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The documentation for this project was very spread out and
        frustrating to look up. However, I found no other issues with
        this project.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 6 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>There was some confusion with the use of DoorReversal in this
        implementation of this elevator but other than that. We found no
        other issues with this project <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 7 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Very straightforward lab. The acceptance test is 6000 seconds
        long though? Seems a little extreme.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 8<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The instructions for the project were very clear.&nbsp; We
        have no suggestions.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 9<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The grading rubric, under "Testing", says that all tests
        should be passing in the parenthesis, or at least that's how we
        interpreted that statement. However in 2 other places we found
        that the project says we do need to pass all tests, but it needs
        to compile.&nbsp; So maybe consider re-wording this sentence or
        change it and maybe add a closing parenthesis.<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect line: "Is the Unit Test Log complete and up to date
        (all controller modules listed, all tests passing, input and
        output files properly linked."<br>
        Cell directly below incorrect line: "All tests must execute
        without throwing java runtime exceptions, but it is ok if there
        are failed assertions"<br>
