    </h1>

    Group 22 - Brody Anderson (bcanders), Jeff Lau (jalau), David Chow
    (davidcho), Yang Liu (yangliu2)<br>
    <hr style="width: 100%; height: 2px;">For each submission, you
    should update this log with a list of ideas or suggestions you have
    for improving the project.&nbsp; This could include identifying bugs
    in the project handouts or documentation, identifying parts of the
    project that were unclear or confusing, and offering ideas for new
    features for the simulator.&nbsp; If you have no suggestions or
    issues for a particular project, add an entry that says "no
    suggestions" or something similar.<br>
    <br>
    Project 1<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Explicitly state how a .cf file should be written. While the
        end result is very simple, I found myself scrambling to find
        some resource before finally getting the simple solution from a
        TA several hours later.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 2<br>
    <ul>
      <li>No Suggestions</li>
    </ul>
    Project 3<br>
    <ul>
      <li>The instructions for the various assignments associated with
        this project, while all documented well, were not presented in a
        very clear manner. This made the assignment of tasks somewhat
        confusing.</li>
    </ul>
    Project 4 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The state variable CurrentFloor can be assigned to the floor
        just reached previously instead of None. This will make it more
        consistent.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 5 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>The documentation for this project was very spread out and
        frustrating to look up. However, I found no other issues with
        this project.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 6 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>There was some confusion with the use of DoorReversal in this
        implementation of this elevator but other than that. We found no
        other issues with this project <br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    Project 7 <br>
    <ul>
      <li>Very straightforward lab. The acceptance test is 6000 seconds
        long though? Seems a little extreme.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 8<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The instructions for the project were very clear.&nbsp; We
        have no suggestions.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>Project 9<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>The grading rubric, under "Testing", says that all tests
        should be passing in the parenthesis, or at least that's how we
        interpreted that statement. However in 2 other places we found
        that the project says we do need to pass all tests, but it needs
        to compile.&nbsp; So maybe consider re-wording this sentence or
        change it and maybe add a closing parenthesis.<br>
        <br>
        Incorrect line: "Is the Unit Test Log complete and up to date
        (all controller modules listed, all tests passing, input and
        output files properly linked."<br>
        Cell directly below incorrect line: "All tests must execute
        without throwing java runtime exceptions, but it is ok if there
        are failed assertions"<br>

      <li>No suggestions.</li>

    <p>Project 13<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>I think a little more clarification on when you can do
        practice runs and when your final demo is actually due. We were
        a little confused on whether the appointment we signed up for
        was for the practice run or for the final.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Overall Project Comments<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>We wished TAs would give better feedback and in a more timely
        manner.&nbsp; We understand they are busy CMU students as well,
        however we would want to look at it early in the week to fix the
        previous issues, but wouldn't see them until a couple days
        before the due date.&nbsp; If we had to fix a previous error, it
        sometimes affected the work we were doing that week, giving us
        even less time to fix everything on time.&nbsp; Also, in the
        grading rubrics we received, there were some criteria where we
        lost points but nothing was under the "notes" section, leaving
        us confused as to what we got wrong.&nbsp; For example when we
        ran our unit and integration tests, they ran perfectly on our
        machines, but apparently they didn't for the TA, and it would be
        helpful to know which ones were wrong.</li>
